# Ruleset interpolation

The biggest tension in [responsive web design](glossary/#responsive-web-design) is the interaction between [flexible media and inflexible text](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/). In responsive layouts, text behaves like an incompressible liquid that expands in the [block](glossary/#block) direction as it is compressed in the [inline](glossary/#inline) direction. Conversely, flexible media shrinks in the block direction proportionally to shrinking in the inline direction.

Providing a toolset to interpolate styles as containers shrink will allow web authors to ensure text is well styled regardless of layout or device. Balancing [line length](glossary/#measure), [font size](glossary/#font-size), and [line height](glossary/#line-height) along with [variable font](glossary/#variable-font) settings like [optical size](glossary/#optical-size), [width](glossary/#width), and [weight](glossary/#weight).
