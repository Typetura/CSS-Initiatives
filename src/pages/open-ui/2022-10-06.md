# Open UI 10/6/2022

[Agenda](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/blob/main/meetings/telecon/2022-10-06.md)

### [selectmenu] Method to apply styles only in open state [#547](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/547)

- Recently resolved to add by the CSSWG
- Resolve to support it

### [Popup] Should blur() be a light dismiss trigger? [#415](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/415)

- Issue when tabbing away form a popup, does it close? Suggest default behavior be to not dismiss popup on blur.

- With close on blur, there is not a good way to get back to the popup. Without this itâ€™s likely there will be confusion as to if the popup is 
- Left unresolved

### [Popup] What is the interaction between popup and other top layer elements [#520](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/520)

- What takes precedence when there is both a popup and a modal?
- Modal should always win or an error should be thrown and a change is blocked



Overall this was a fantastic discussion of popup and modal behavior and what should be default. Examples were provided both for and against behavior with consideration of different input types and use cases.
