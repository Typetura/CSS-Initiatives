# Open UI 8/25/2022

- Modal behavior and when it might conflict with being a popup

- Input type[range]
  - Ana Tudor working on this
  - Need an explainer added
  - How does this work with the slider and progress element?
  - https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/QWQQqmP
  - Ana’s demos need to change as browsers change things about input[type=’range’]
