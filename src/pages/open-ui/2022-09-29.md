# Open UI 9/29/2022

### [Selectmenu] Change arrow icon for dropdown select [#548](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/548)

- What do we call the icon area? How is this replaced?
- Maybe we can use “marker” instead?
- Question: why was this originally called “marker”?
- Will this be confusing with `::marker` and can/should we also use `::marker`?

### [selectmenu] How should writing-mode work with selectmenu [#600](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/600)

- Where to change “should” to “must”
- There are some languages like Mongolian that must be presented vertically, unlike CJK that can be written both horizontally and vertically
- Button elements also have issues here in Chromium
- Add support for write modes on inputs in Intro 2023

### [select] Should the inner HTML & styles of the selected option be copied into selected-value? [#571](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/571), [selectmenu] Method to apply styles only in open state [#547](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/issues/547)
