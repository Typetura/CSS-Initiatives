# CSS Typographic Initiatives

This is the project space for the open web standards work of [Scott Kellum](https://scottkellum.com) and [Typetura](https://typetura.com).

Making typography on the web better is the reason why Typetura was founded, and improving the web platform as a whole is critical to achieving this goal. This project space is made possible by the generous support of the [Google UI Fund](https://web.dev/ui-fund/).

## [Ruleset interpolation](ruleset-interpolation)

The biggest tension in [responsive web design](glossary/#responsive-web-design) is the interaction between [flexible media and inflexible text](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/). In responsive layouts, text behaves like an incompressible liquid that expands in the [block](glossary/#block) direction as it is compressed in the [inline](glossary/#inline) direction. Conversely, flexible media shrinks in the block direction proportionally to shrinking in the inline direction.

Providing a toolset to interpolate styles as containers shrink will allow web authors to ensure text is well styled regardless of layout or device. Balancing [line length](glossary/#measure), [font size](glossary/#font-size), and [line height](glossary/#line-height) along with [variable font](glossary/#variable-font) settings like [optical size](glossary/#optical-size), [width](glossary/#width), and [weight](glossary/#weight).

## [Glossary](glossary)

Typographic terms can be confusing. The differences between terms like leading and line height, type design and typography, and typeface and font can dramatically change what is being communicated. Itâ€™s important to have clear and well documented definitions of the terms we use to ensure we are all on the same page.

## [Web typography audit](typography-audit)

There is a lot of work that has been done to make the web a better place for typography. There is also a lot of low-hanging fruit that needs to be implemented, is implemented and needs a clear spec, or where there is opportunity for iteration. This is a survey of these areas and where we might improve typography on the web platform incrementally.
